// DecimalToBinary (Java)
// Logic and Coded for Interview practice
// A simple converter from a decimal number to a binary format

import java.util.Scanner;
public class DecimalToBinary {
public static void main(String[]args) {
	Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	int dec = input.nextInt();
	int start = dec;
	String temp = "";		// Creating a temp String
	String bin = "";		// Produced after reversing the temp

	// The logic behind this. Given an example of 10, divide it by 2. so 5 is present then add 0 to the String since no remainders and repeat with 5 divide by 2
	// 5 / 2 gives 2.5 which has remainer of .5 , so add 1 to the String and repeat until the String "0101" is created then reverse it in terms on Binary format


	while(start>=1) {		// Creating a loop until it reaches 1
	if(start%2==0) {
	temp += "0";
		}					// Simple logic behind the number being divisble by 2(No remains) or not
	else{
	temp += "1";
		}

	start /= 2;				// Divide by 2
	}

	int end = temp.length()-1;
	while(end>=0) {
		bin += temp.charAt(end);		// Reversing the String
		end--;
		}

		System.out.println(bin);		// Prints out the Binary format, I have tried decimal "999" and received outcome "1111100111" which is correct
